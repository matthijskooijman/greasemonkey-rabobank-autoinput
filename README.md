Rabobank autoinput script
-------------------------
This is a simple script that makes the login / signing screen for the
dutch bank "Rabobank" more useful. By default, it allows saving one pair
of bank account / card number, which is of course utterly useless if you
have multiple separate accounts.

This extension allows saving multiple pairs and selecting between them
with a single click. Of course it is still possible to manually enter an
account number as well.

Editing the list of account numbers happens on the login page itself,
there is an edit link underneath the table.
